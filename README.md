# Open city profile

**This is a version of the app which is used for the MyDataShare pilot**

## Summary

Open city profile is used to store common information (name, contact 
information, areas of interests, ...) about the citizens of the city of Helsinki.

When a citizen is using a service which is connected to the profile, the 
service can query for the citizen's information from the profile so that the 
citizen doesn't have to enter all of their data every time it is needed. The 
services may also provide a better user experience using the profile's data, 
for example by returning more relevant search results based on the citizen's 
interests.

The same data may also be queried by the employees of the city of Helsinki 
while performing their daily duties, for example using the administrative 
functions of Venepaikka service.

Open city profile is implemented using Django and it provides a GraphQL API.

## Development with Docker

1. Create `.env` environment file

2. Set the `DEBUG` environment variable to `1`

3. Run `docker-compose up`

4. Run migrations if needed: 
    * `docker exec profile-backend python manage.py migrate`

5. Create superuser if needed: 
    * `docker exec -it profile-backend python manage.py createsuperuser`
    
6. Import relevant Helsinki regions if needed:

    * `docker exec profile-backend python manage.py geo_import finland --municipalities`
    * `docker exec profile-backend python manage.py geo_import helsinki --divisions`
    * `docker exec profile-backend python manage.py mark_divisions_of_interest`

7. Generate services: (command doesn't overwrite existing services with same 
`service_type`)
   
    * `docker exec profile-backend python manage.py generate_services`
  
8. Set permissions for service staff members if needed:
   
   * Create group(s) (via Django admin) and add user(s) to the group
   * Create service permissions for group manually via Django admin or for example:
     * `docker exec profile-backend python manage.py add_object_permission BERTH 
     VeneAdmin can_view_profiles`
     * where:
       * `service_type=BERTH`
       * `group_name=VeneAdmin`
       * `permission=can_view_profiles`
   * Permissions can be removed as follows:
     * `docker exec profile-backend python manage.py remove_object_permission BERTH 
     VeneAdmin can_view_profiles`

9. Seed development data (optional). This command will flush the database.

    * Add all data with defaults: `docker exec profile-backend python manage.py 
    seed_data`
    * See `python manage.py help seed_data` for optional arguments
    * Command will generate:
      * All available services
      * One group per service (with `can_manage_profiles` permissions)
      * One user per group (with username `{service_type}_user`)
      * Profiles
        * With user
        * With email, phone number and address 
        * Connects to one random service
      * Youth profiles
        * Adds for existing profiles
        * By default adds for 20% of profiles (0.2)
        * Approved randomly

10.  Run the server:
    * `docker exec -it profile-backend python manage.py runserver 0:8000`

## Development without Docker

### Install pip-tools

* Run `pip install pip-tools`

### Creating Python requirements files

* Run `pip-compile requirements.in`
* Run `pip-compile requirements-dev.in`

### Updating Python requirements files

* Run `pip-compile --upgrade requirements.in`
* Run `pip-compile --upgrade requirements-dev.in`

### Installing Python requirements

* Run `pip-sync requirements.txt requirements-dev.in`

### Database

To setup a database compatible with default database settings:

Create user and database

    sudo -u postgres createuser -P -R -S open_city_profile  # use password `open_city_profile`
    sudo -u postgres createdb -O open_city_profile open_city_profile

Allow user to create test database

    sudo -u postgres psql -c "ALTER USER open_city_profile CREATEDB;"

### Import administrative divisions

In order to have the relevant Helsinki regions run the following commands:

* `python manage.py geo_import finland --municipalities`
* `python manage.py geo_import helsinki --divisions`
* `python manage.py mark_divisions_of_interest`

### Daily running

* Set the `DEBUG` environment variable to `1`.
* Run `python manage.py migrate`
* Run `python manage.py runserver 0:8000`

## Running tests

* Set the `DEBUG` environment variable to `1`.
* Run `pytest`.
