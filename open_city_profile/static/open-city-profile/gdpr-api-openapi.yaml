            The service allows and has done everything needed so that it no longer contains personal data for the identified profile. This response is also given in the case that the service does not contain any data for the profile or is completely unaware of the identified profile.

            If the `dry_run` parameter is `true`, and no actual data erasure takes place, this response means that the service allows the data erasure.
